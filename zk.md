## Features
- use *validity proofs* 
1. each batch includes a cryptographic proof (ZK-SNARK) that proves post-state root is correct 
2. proof can be quickly verified on chain
## Challenges
The challenge with ZK rollups is that at present theyâ€™re not capable of supporting general-purpose EVM computation

## roadmap
> the ethereum ecosystem is likely to be all-in on rollups (plus some plasma and channels) as a scaling strategy for the near and mid-term future. eth2â€™s long-term future is a single high-security execution shard that everyone processes, plus a scalable data availability layer.
### short term: 
- protocol: eth core dev focusing on increasing how much data blocks can hold
- infrastructure: 
    - accounts, balances, assets move to L2
    - direct wallet integration
    - cross L2 asset transfers 
    - standardize intermediate compiling language (eg Yul) 
### long term: 
- ethereum: 15 TPS
- rollups: 3000 TPS
- rollups on eth2 sharded chains: 100000 TPS

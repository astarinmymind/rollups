## overview
- zk-snark stands for zero knowledge succinct arguments of knowledge 
- generate a proof that computation has certain output
- proof must be verified quickly
- can sometimes keep inputs to computation hidden
- this means scalability + privacy 

## polynomials
- key feature: can contain unbounded amount of information 
- a single equation can represent unbounded number of equations
- polynomial commitments: a way to "hash" a polynomial where you can check equations between polynomials by checking equations between their hashes
